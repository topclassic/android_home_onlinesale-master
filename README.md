<h1>This is a sample code of using Android to do CRUD to MySQL via PHP</h1>
<p></p>
<h1>Note</h1> 
I. The android code was done with the old Eclipse (ADT). If you want to make it work, there are two solutions for that. 
    1st, you can download the old ADT verison "adt-bundle-mac-x86_64-20130729" for Mac OSX. And for windows, it is a similar name
    with 20130729 at the end.
    2nd, if you use Android Studio (based on InteliJ Idea), you can import it to Android Studio. Most of time, it converts to Gradle correctly.
<p></p>
II. PHP is also for PHP older version 5.3. So if you are using a newer version WAMP, MAMP, or XAMPP, you may need to either:
    1. place code <b>error_reporting(E_WARNING)</b> in the 1st line after <b><?PHP</b> tag of connnection.php<br/>
    2. rewrite newer code with MySQLi or PDO.
<p></p>
My Recommendation
    For the sake of testing, I would recommend you to:
    1. Download older ADT 20130729, and
    2. add error_reporting(E_WARNING)

<h1>How to Set Up</h1>
I posted a video on Youtube on how to set it up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GINPNd2cBTc
<br />
It is in the series 12 in Android playlist. Unfortunately, I spoke Khmer (Cambodian language) in the video.
<p></p>
Use it for your own sake.
